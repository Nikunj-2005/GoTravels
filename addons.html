<b><u>Visa Assistance</u></b><br>
Attaining the appropriate travel visas can be confusing and stressful for first-time travelers. Take advantage of our optional visa assistance services to have GoTravels' visa experts guide you and your group through the visa process step by step. This will ensure that you have got everything you need to have a successful international trip.<br><br>

<b><u>Insurance</u></b><br>
Travel insurance is the most common add-on item for GoTravels' clients. It covers cancellations, lost luggage, medical emergencies, and other unforeseen emergencies during your trip. Travel insurance protects you from financial liability if an emergency arises, and allows you to recoup your travel investment if your trip must be cancelled or cut short for any reason.<br><br>

<b><u>Optional Tours</u></b><br>
During your trip, you will have the opportunity to participate in several optional tours. These tours go beyond the standard tourist experience, and are designed to give you a memorable glimpse into local culture, history, and entertainment.<br>
